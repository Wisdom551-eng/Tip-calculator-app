## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
-Javascript

### What I learned
I have learnt alot from this challenge. I got to know how to run the calculator once the user inputs the values.
for example;
---function calculateTip() {
  const bill = parseFloat(billInput.value);
  const people = parseInt(peopleInput.value);---
I have also deepened my knowledge when it comes to positioning and styling of individual contatiners.
I was happy to see how I applied div elements in this challenge;
e.g    <div class="container">
            <div class="left-panel">
              <div class="bill-input">
                <label for="bill">Bill</label>
                <div class="input-icon-container">
       the whole assignment was just wow.

### Continued development
I will be looking forward to improving and learning more on how to make projects work automatically once a user inputs values.I have done part of this in this challenge but I feel like I still need to refine and make myself perfect.
Rest assured i would also like to dvelop my whole javascript CSS skills thus will be looking forward to projects requiring much of these.

I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
